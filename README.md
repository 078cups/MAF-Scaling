# MAF-Scaling

The repo is used to continually update different MAF transfer functions as i discover them.
This spreadsheet will calculate new maf scalars based on changes to tube size and/or adding a resistor.

I originally created this spreadsheet for MS41 and have recently expanded it to MS43 which requires a different calculation for resistors due to different internal resistance to MS41.


If my work proves helpful to you, donations are appreciated.
